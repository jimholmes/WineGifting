### Major Grape Types

**Reds**

* **Cabernet sauvignon:** Heavy, dark grape produced throughout much of the world. Major grape for most wines from Bordeaux. Generally deep berry flavors, some green pepper.
* **Merlot:** Moderately heavy, widely grown. Bottled on its own, but also widely used as a blending grape for cabernet sauvignon and other heavy reds. Smoother than cab sauv, often with lots of berry flavors.
* **Cabernet franc:** Mid-bodied grape, widely grown. Main variety in France's Chinon and Bourgueil regions. Also widely used in blending.
* **Pinot noir:** Finicky grape that runs light- to mid-bodied. Primary grape for red Burgundy. Styles vary widely depending on region and grower.
* Pinotage
* Zinfandel
* Syrah
* Grenache
* Nebbiolo
* Sangiovese
* Temperanillo

**Red Blends/Regions**

* French
	* **Bordeaux:** Likely France's best-known wine region. Styles and blends vary widely in different sub-regions. St. Emilion is known for wines with a majority of merlot. St. Estephe typically uses lots of cabernet franc. Medoc wines are primarily cabernet sauvignon.
	* **Languedoc:** Southern France's country region is known for a wide range of wines. One of the regions "trademark" traits is a very herbal and lavender component thanks to the region's dense population of wild and crop lavender and herbs.
